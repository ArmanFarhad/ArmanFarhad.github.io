        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            You are a drifter, drift fam. The implemented a time system so when you complete one 
                <br>lap, your time is recorded. You are the randomness. The way that you move is
                <br>what causes it to be random. As you progress through the game, you try to 
                <br>get a faster time. It becomes increasingly difficult. The game ends as soon 
                <br>as you click the close button on your browser. The point of the game is just 
                <br>to beat your best time so there is no end to the game?
        </p>   
        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p> The reason that I created this game was just for the love of cars and racing games. 
        <br>I have always had an interest in cars and this was an idea that I was thinking about. 
        <br>What inspired me to make this game is the love for the Fast and Furious Franchise.
        <br>I was very proud of the drifting mechanics and the map on the top left side of the game. 
        <br>I had to overcome the drifting mechanics. Another was the timed laps. 
        <br>I overcame these challenges by looking at many other games and looking online for any advice.
        <br>If I had more time, I would make the road look better and I would add Nicholas Cage as a 
        <br>character select.

        <p>
            This algorithm is a large part of how the laps are timed and how the colors of the markers 
        <br>change. As the car hits on of the specified colors, the lap and the location is updated.
        <br>The car must touch the color in order to successfully complete a lap.

        <p>
            This are my blocks. I got a majority of them through the help 
            <br>of my friends and getting them from other Scratch games. :)
