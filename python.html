            <br><h2>Python: Become Human</h2><hr>
            <p>Become Human is a emotional story about a man named Hank that is a detective for the Chicago Police Department.<br>  
            All was good until his wife went to get groceries and she was gunned down. Hank attempts to find the killer and <br>
            bring them to justice... or does he? Some programming concepts I learned and applied to this story were the if <br>
            statements. The if statements played an important role because it managed which scene would be showing next, depending on <br>
            the choice that was selected. Another concept I applied to this story was functions. <br>
            This allowed me to code in a much cleaner manor and was able to identify each scene.<br>
            Thinking back to the stories that I read, the one that peaked my interest is Jeremy's. It had a great story <br>
            with many choices that the user could branch out to.</p><br>
